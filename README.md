Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a Computer Programming student (graduating May 2026), and this repository showcases a collection of my class assignments and personal projects in **C++** and **Python**.

Each project here represents a step in my learning journey—where I challenged myself, solved real-world problems, and built my understanding of software development. My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to impactful work—whether that's as part of a company or through freelance collaborations.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Island Perimeter Calculator (C++)
This program calculates the perimeter of an island represented as a 2D grid using a basic algorithm and file input/output.

#### What I Learned:
- Navigating and manipulating 2D vectors.
- Designing efficient logic for grid-based problems.
- Reading and writing from files.

#### Challenges I Overcame:
- Accounting for edge cases (like small or oddly shaped islands).
- Debugging logic errors in edge counting.
- Writing clean, understandable code with consistent structure.

### 2. Payroll Generator (C++)
A program that calculates employee pay using hours worked and hourly rate, then outputs a payroll summary to a file.

#### What I Learned:
- Object-oriented programming using classes.
- Working with file input/output to simulate real-world reporting.
- Handling mathematical logic and formatting results clearly.

#### Challenges I Overcame:
- Designing a scalable solution that could work with multiple employees.
- Managing inputs like overtime and floating-point precision.
- Keeping the code modular and readable.

---

### 3. Numbers & Weights Processor (Python)
This Python program collects a list of numbers and weights from the user, then performs average calculations and sorts the weights.

#### What I Learned:
- Python list manipulation and loops.
- Writing functions to break down a task into manageable pieces.
- Input validation and output formatting.

#### Challenges I Overcame:
- Catching and handling invalid input smoothly.
- Keeping the program logic clean and efficient.
- Writing statistical calculations without built-in libraries.

---

### 4. Paint Calculator (Python)
A real-world application that calculates how much paint is needed based on wall size and chosen paint type, and estimates the cost.

#### What I Learned:
- Using dictionaries to handle paint prices by color.
- Performing surface area calculations and cost estimates.
- Creating a user-friendly experience with clear outputs.

#### Challenges I Overcame:
- Designing logic that works for a wide range of wall dimensions.
- Preventing calculation errors from invalid or missing input.
- Keeping the output readable and useful for any user.

---

### 5. ATM Simulator (Python)
A functional simulation of an ATM system that supports deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and persistent file storage.

#### What I Learned:
- Simulating real-world systems with logic and flow control.
- Managing files to store user account information.
- Creating a secure and intuitive transaction system.

#### Challenges I Overcame:
- Handling invalid transactions (e.g., overdrafts or typos).
- Ensuring the account balance updated correctly across sessions.
- Keeping the code secure, simple, and bug-free.

## Why This Portfolio?

These projects demonstrate more than just my understanding of programming languages—they showcase my **problem-solving mindset**, **attention to detail**, and **ability to take a concept from start to finish**. Every project here helped me grow, make mistakes, fix them, and become more confident as a programmer.

I didn’t just complete assignments—I learned from each one. That includes:
- Debugging under pressure.
- Writing user-friendly code.
- Applying class concepts in creative ways.
- Structuring files and logic to simulate real-world tools.

If you're looking for someone who’s hands-on, adaptable, and excited to keep learning—I’d love to connect. I'm open to **entry-level roles**, **internships**, or even **freelance projects** where I can contribute and continue to build experience.
